        <h3>A Good Game Starts from the Ground Up</h3>
        <p>November 9th, 2025</p>
      </hgroup>

      <p>
        I have had the pleasure of introducing people to pickleball over the last few years
        and I always make a point to stress the importance of proper footwear and safety
        glasses/goggles.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to footwear it's important to ensure that you're wearing the right
        type of shoe for whatever activity you participate in. For running you want running
        shoes - for pickleball you want court shoes - there is a difference. Court shoes have
        more support on the sides giving more protection with the side to side movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're going to play once a month and are not playing with intensity you may very
        well get by with running shoes when playing pickleball. For the majority of people it's
        well worth investing in a pair of good quality court shoes (or perhaps 2 pairs). I say 2
        pairs because they make indoor, outdoor, and indoor/outdoor shoes. I personally buy
        indoor and outdoor shoes (because I play indoor and outdoor pickleball). I once bought a
        pair of indoor/outdoor shoes and I found that they wore out quickly when wearing them
        outdoor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proper footwear can help protect you from injury. I competed in races for 13 years and
        always wore good running shoes and followed the recommendation as to when to get a new
        pair (every 300 to 500 miles). Only once in that time did I start feeling some knee pain
        - that's when I realized that I had over 500 miles on that pair and as soon as I bought
        a new pair the knee pain went away. Had I not listened to my body it could have led to
        requiring a long layoff from racing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what I'm saying is that not only is proper footwear important but also knowing when
        it's time to invest in a new pair! Minimizing the risk of injury and staying in good
        health is important - you owe yourself that!

        <h3>Is power really that important?</h3>
        <p>October 11th, 2025</p>
      </hgroup>

      <img src="img/blog-2025-10-11.png" />
      <p>
        It depends on how you define power. In my opinion, banging balls back and forth may
        feel like power, but there is so much more to the game. It's important to learn precision
        and ball placement and not just hitting the ball hard. A lob deep in the court, a well-
        placed cross court dink or a top spin flick down the centre line beats power … especially
        when the power isn't controlled and the ball ends up in the net or outside the court.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we are learning to play, we tend to stay at the back of the court, smashing and
        banging the ball back and forth. I will admit, it is fun to drive the ball. So I get it. But as
        you advance, you discover that banging the ball isn't enough as your opponents WILL
        return the ball. And keep in mind, the harder you hit the ball, the harder it returns.
        Sooo….. if you use power against a banger, you have to be ready. Trust me, I've taken
        a few balls to the body because I wasn't.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So how do you outplay bangers? One way is to soften the game. When you are at the
        back of the court, try a drop shot. Aim for the kitchen. You want the ball to drop so that
        they cannot take it out of the air. Plus, a drop shot gives you the time to get to the
        kitchen which is a power move as you move from a defense position to offense.
        Another shot to try is the reset. This is typically done when you are closer to the net
        and you tap the ball into the kitchen, aim for their feet, it's a great power move. A third
        power move to beat a banger is the lob shot. The lob is most effective when you're all
        at the kitchen, your opponent is leaning forward to volley the ball and you lob it over
        their head. This puts them into defense mode as they run for the ball, and you maintain
        offense at the kitchen line.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Being powerful in the game, isn't just about hitting the ball with lots of force, it's about
        playing smart and being strategic. Once you learn and practice the soft game, the
        precision of your shot, the placement of your balls, adding spin, flicks, punches … then,
        in my opinion, you can add more power to your shots.

        <h3>You Were Once a Newbie - Remember?</h3>
        <p>September 8th, 2025</p>
      </hgroup>

      <img src="img/blog-2025-09-08.png" />
      <p>
        Do you remember when you were a pickleball newbie? Do you recall being ignored by
        more experienced players and feeling unwelcomed? I am certain it happened to you.
        Think back to how that felt.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone wants to play competitively but we should not forget that we were newbies at
        one time. Hopefully you had some people treat you with respect along your journey to
        offset those that did not.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you are a more experienced player I beg you to help those who are less
        skilled than you instead of ignoring them, trying to avoid playing with them or rolling your
        eyes. Use it as an opportunity to teach. I promise you will feel good about having made
        someone's development in the sport that you and I love a little more pleasurable. They
        will thank you for your patience and commitment and you will feel good about having
        made someone's day.

        <h3>Unconventional Ed</h3>
        <p>August 3rd, 2025</p>

        I ran many races over a 13 year period and had many memorable experiences.
        The highlight however was meeting Ed Whitlock who held many world records
        and who ran the full marathon 3 times in under 3 hours in his 70's - That
        is INSANE!      
      </p>
      <p>
        According to almost every source out there to properly train for
        a race (especially a long race) you need to vary your running by doing speed
        workouts, tempo runs, long runs, and other types. Ed did none of that. His
        training involved doing a slow run almost every day in a cemetery for three
        hours. Very unconventional.       
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this have to do with pickleball ? In
        running and other sports (pickleball included) there are best practices and
        standards you are told you should follow and I do not disagree with following
        what the experts say. I am reminded when I think of Ed that sometimes you may
        be doing something that does not follow recommendations but it works for you.
        In that case it is my opinion that it is not wrong and you do not necessarily
        have to change your quirky ways.
