        <h3>You Were Once a Newbie - Remember?</h3>
        <p>September 8th, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Do you remember when you were a pickleball newbie? Do you recall being ignored by
        more experienced players and feeling unwelcomed? I am certain it happened to you.
        Think back to how that felt.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone wants to play competitively but we should not forget that we were newbies at
        one time. Hopefully you had some people treat you with respect along your journey to
        offset those that did not.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that you are a more experienced player I beg you to help those who are less
        skilled than you instead of ignoring them, trying to avoid playing with them or rolling your
        eyes. Use it as an opportunity to teach. I promise you will feel good about having made
        someone's development in the sport that you and I love a little more pleasurable. They
        will thank you for your patience and commitment and you will feel good about having
        made someone's day.

        <h3>Unconventional Ed</h3>

        I ran many races over a 13 year period and had many memorable experiences.
        The highlight however was meeting Ed Whitlock who held many world records
        and who ran the full marathon 3 times in under 3 hours in his 70's - That
        is INSANE!      
      </p>
      <p>
        According to almost every source out there to properly train for
        a race (especially a long race) you need to vary your running by doing speed
        workouts, tempo runs, long runs, and other types. Ed did none of that. His
        training involved doing a slow run almost every day in a cemetery for three
        hours. Very unconventional.       
      </p>
      <p>
        What does this have to do with pickleball ? In
        running and other sports (pickleball included) there are best practices and
        standards you are told you should follow and I do not disagree with following
        what the experts say. I am reminded when I think of Ed that sometimes you may
        be doing something that does not follow recommendations but it works for you.
        In that case it is my opinion that it is not wrong and you do not necessarily
        have to change your quirky ways.
