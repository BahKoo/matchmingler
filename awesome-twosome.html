      <h3>What is this all about?</h3>
      <p>
        This is a unique concept where you team up with anyone of any age and
        compete in your combined age group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add your age and your partner's age to determine your age category. You
        then pick your level (from 2.5 to 4.5). Men's, women's and mixed events
        will be offered.
      </p>

      <h3>This is neat!</h3>
      <p>
        This format would open the door to a number of different pairings. For
        example a parent can team up with a child or a grandmother or
        grandfather can team up with a grandchild.
      </p>
      <p>
        The combinations that would be formed would make the tournament full of
        surprises. Two 40 year olds could end up playing against a team
        consisting of a 60 year old and a 28 year old (both would fall within
        the 75-99 combined age category). There is no advantage to either side
        providing that both teams pick the appropriate skill level category
        (from 2.5 to level 4.5).
      </p>

      <h3>When will this take place?</h3>
      <p>
        There will be multiple tournaments offered in 2025 depending on demand.
        As soon as one category has 8 teams it's a GO and a date will be
        chosen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plan is to have these on weekends to allow everyone a chance to
        participate.
      </p>

      <h3>Cost</h3>
      <p>
        The cost is $60 per team - payable only when a date has been chosen and
        providing the date chosen is acceptable to you.
      </p>

      <h5>Categories</h5>
