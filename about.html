          <p>
            My name is Pierre (Pete) Gagné. In conjunction with my wife Gisèle
            we have run a number of Singles Mingle events since August of 2024.
            We are happy that we now have a web site which will facilitate
            sharing of information regarding all upcoming events (Singles Mingle
            and others).
          </p>
          <p>
            Special thanks to our son Paul who developed this web page and will
            continue to work on it as we improve the site and share information.

          <h3>Pierre</h3>
          <p>
            My background is that of a computer analyst/programmer having worked
            my entire career in that industry. I have been an owner of race
            horses for many years. I have always enjoyed running and for quite a
            few years competed in 5K, 10K and half marathon races. Due to all of
            the training required to compete I decided to simply run for fun
            starting at the age of 62. Besides running I enjoy playing and
            teaching pickleball and going for long bike rides.
          </p>

          <h3>Gisèle</h3>
          <p>
            Gisèle was a teacher for her entire adult life (until retirement 12
            years ago) in a French school followed by many years teaching French
            immersion at various schools in the southern part of Winnipeg. She
            was devoted to her profession and enjoyed teaching the younger
            children and working as a teacher-librarian.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gisèle loves her pickleball and continues to play 3 times a week
            despite 2 bad knees and a bad hip. People she has played with and
            against her have commented on her awesome serves.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next few years Gisèle will be looking into knee and hip
            surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has always enjoyed cooking and I have always enjoyed eating her
            prepared dishes.
          </p>

          <h3>Together</h3>
          <p>
            Gisèle and I married at the young age of 20 and celebrated 48 years of
            marriage in July (2025). We first went out in grade 7. We
            have 3 wonderful children - 2 boys and a girl.
