      <h1>Skill Levels</h1>

      <h3>How do you pick a level?</h3>
      <p>
        It can be challenging picking a level - especially if you have never
        played in a tournament. An individual may have an idea what level 
        they are at and some have no clue. What upsets a lot of people is when
        a team intentionally chooses to play at a level lower than they should
        be playing at. A rule of thumb is if one player is at a 3.5 level (for
        example) and the partner is at the 3.0 level the team should play at 3.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following is a guide that I put in place that may help you choose a
        level. I came up with this and others might see it slightly differently
        but I believe this could be used to help make a choice.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 2.5</h3>
      <p>
        For people who have been playing for only a short while that do not feel
        they fit the Novice category (higher than the novice level). Also for
        lower intermediate players.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 3.0</h3>
      <p>
        For middle of the road intermediate players.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 3.5</h3>
      <p>
        For lower to middle advanced players.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 4.0</h3>
      <p>
        For higher advanced players.
