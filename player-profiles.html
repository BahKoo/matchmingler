        One introduction to pickleball clinic with my husband in the summer of 2024
        quickly turned into my favorite sport to play. In November 2024 I started
        playing a few times and week and haven't stopped!  At first, it was so my
        husband, Mitchell and I could have a sport to play together - and while
        that's still the case - I now play much more often than him! If I could play
        every day of the week I would!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always loved being involved in sports including volleyball, curling,
        ultimate frisbee, and disc golf. I still play volleyball twice a week during
        the season, but nothing has caught on like pickleball! I found that having
        court skills from volleyball helped me adjust to pickleball quickly. I also
        love that pickleball can be played both inside and outdoors all year round.
        I played as much as I could, building my fundamentals with a great crew in
        St. Norbert. Then in the summer of 2025, my husband and I joined friends in
        an outdoor league which helped us met even more fun people in the pickleball
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who works full-time as a Speech Therapist during the week, I'm
        always looking for games in the evenings and weekends - where ever I am - to
        stay active and connected! I continue to play in leagues and even some
        tournaments. If you somehow find me not playing pickleball, I also love time
        spent with my incredible friends - especially ones with dogs, enjoying all the
        great restaurants in the city, shopping at local markets, and spending time
        with family anywhere where I can put a paddle board in the lake.

        Hi everyone, I'm Tracey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered Pickleball in the summer of 2023, when it was offered outside
        at St Norbert CC through Fort Garry Young at Heart. Instantly I knew I wanted
        to continue playing after the summer ended. In the fall, I found Marcels St
        Norbert group. The group was so welcoming and fun to play with that I've been
        playing there ever since joining.   
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also participated in a few tournaments organized by Pete, which are
        always so much fun! And discovered some very nice outside courts for summer play.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to pickleball I enjoy spending time with family and friends. I have
        2 grown sons, a daughter in law and twin 2 year old granddaughters. (That are
        very busy little girls ) I have a seasonal site at a campground near LDB where
        I spend a lot of my summer enjoying golfing, kayaking and just relaxing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newly retired, I look forward to playing more pickleball. It's been a wonderful
        journey so far! Great exercise and a great way to meet some very awesome people
        that otherwise I would have never met.

        Some call me TraderDave — others just call me the guy who hits a few “accidental winners”
        in Pickleball. With a background in tennis and ping-pong, this sport was the perfect
        evolution for me — especially as a relatively new single who enjoys friendly competition
        and the occasional strategic body shot (nothing personal, of course... what?).  I play
        with an amazing and impressive group of individuals, many who I now call my dear friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally from Montreal, I started flying airplanes before some people started driving
        cars, earning my B.Sc. in Aeronautical Science from the University of North Dakota — my
        second home in Grand Forks, ND. My aviation career took off (literally) as an Air Ambulance
        Pilot in Winnipeg, and I hold both U.S. Commercial and Canadian Airline Transport Pilot
        Licences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere between cloud layers and closing deals, I spent over 20 years in real estate
        investments across Manitoba and Florida, before charting a new course — day trading Nasdaq
        Futures and Forex markets. I now run my TraderDave Discord channel, where I navigate
        volatility with a mix of strategy, and optimism.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm blessed with two brilliant daughters (they clearly got their beauty and brains from
        their mother's side). Off the charts and away from the courts, you'll find me riding my
        motorcycle, exploring new places, or volunteering at Agape Table in YWG — where, every
        Christmas, if you bring a turkey, I'll match it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life's a mix of faith, fun, and futures — and I'm here for all of it.
        See you on the courts — and maybe on the charts. 😉 Jer 29:11

      <p>
        Eugene and Hélène's pickleball journey started in the summer of 2019 when
        they played a few games at the lake for fun. They didn't really play again
        until Helene retired in 2020. She needed something to do while Eugene still
        worked. So she showed up at Dakota Community Center one morning and tried
        playing at the novice level. Well, she wasn't a great player having never
        played any racket sports but got hooked right away. She then suggested to
        Eugene that they could do this together!
      </p>
      <p>
        They started practising and we were not really good. Hélène could barely hit
        the balls that Eugene would serve her. Hélène continued to play over the winter
        at Dakota while Eugene coached hockey. He would try to join her during his
        holidays. After that, they joined a summer league in the south end of the city
        and that's when they truly got hooked playing together as a team. Since then,
        they've played in several small tournaments together, in summer leagues, with
        family members and friends. Pickleball is a sport they can do together and that
        keeps them busy and active.         
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides being pickleball players, Eugene and Hélène are parents of 7 young
        adults, and grandparents to 6 children. They also enjoy travelling, playing
        card and board games as well as spending time at the cottage.

        Hello everyone,
      </p>
      <p>
        I started playing pickleball about a year ago, and I'm excited to be part of this
        community! I enjoy pickleball because it's such a fun and social sport, and I'm
        looking forward to expanding my social circle. As an introvert, I find it a wonderful
        way to meet new people in a relaxed and enjoyable setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        By way of background, I teach in the Engineering and MBA programs at the University
        of Manitoba. On a personal note, I have two adult children I'm very proud of—my
        daughter, 32, is a physiotherapist living in Vancouver, and my son, 29, lives in
        Toronto with his wife while completing his PhD in Psychology.        
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm really looking forward to connecting with others, playing some great games, and
        being part of this vibrant community.      
      </p>

        Our pickleball history started in the fall of 2014 in Mesa Arizona. For the
        next six years we were lucky to winter in Mesa where we were fortunate to
        have weekly lessons. We were blessed to have amazing, positive teachers who
        encouraged us to keep challenging ourselves. Even after a few weeks as
        beginners when we were feeling less than confident of our skills, they
        encouraged us to participate in the Saturday morning scrambles, which were
        mini tournaments complete with medals each week. They instilled confidence
        every step of the way of our pickleball journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our super organized club at Venture Out RV park hosted many large tournaments
        where we were encouraged to take training in being line judges and take referee
        training. Our last two winters there we were invited to teach beginners - once
        again pushing us beyond our comfort zone at the start, but knowing that we were
        ready to take that step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course after experiencing such welcoming people within the Arizona pickleball
        circle, we couldn't wait to engage pickleball in Winnipeg. Once life got back to
        “normal” after the Covid pause, we've enjoyed play at Dakota Community Club in
        St. Vital and Fort Garry Mennonite Brethren on Pembina Highway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pickleball is ideal for keeping the body active and we continue to learn new ways
        to keep improving our skills by taking classes and watching videos. Pickleball has
        tons of benefits: great exercise, helps keep your memory sharp and a great way to
        meet new like-minded folks.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter where we travel we can almost always find a court and meet new pickleball
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of us are involved in coaching and teaching the nuances of the game to usually
        older folks wanting to learn to play or to improve their skills.  We try hard to
        encourage new players in the same way we were mentored over the years. We encourage
        our students to always keep learning and advancing their skills and to consider
        tournament play as another way to test and stretch their abilities.

      <p>
        Hi, I'm Jackie! I found my passion for pickleball in November 2024, thanks to a
        lesson from my good friend Pierre. From the moment my paddle made contact with
        the ball, I was hooked! It's been an exciting journey ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 55, I've lived in Winnipeg my whole life, and this summer, I've spent
        countless hours enjoying the city's beautiful, free-to-play outdoor pickleball
        courts. It's been a great way to explore new neighborhoods, some of which I
        probably never would've discovered if not for pickleball.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what's been even more rewarding than the game itself is the amazing people
        I've met along the way. Through pickleball, I've expanded my social circle and
        formed deep friendships. We've built a close-knit community of like-minded
        individuals who share similar life experiences—many of us navigating life as
        singles in our later years, staying active, and seeking positive outlets for our
        energy. It's truly been a joy to find connection through this sport.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to pickleball, I enjoy gardening, weight lifting, cooking, dancing,
        getting dressed up for a night on the town or snuggling with the furry babies to
        watch something on tv. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends whether it
        is a quiet time of card playing or taking over the dancefloor. I hope to see you
        on the courts!
