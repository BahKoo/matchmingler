      <h3>What is Classic Bracket?</h3>
      <p>
        Classic Bracket is a traditional tournament similar to other
        tournaments you may have participated in previously.
      </p>
      <p>Tournaments normally have the following characteristics:</p>
      <h5>Gender</h5>
      <p>
        Sometimes there are categories available for men, other times women.
        There are also mixed categories.
      </p>
      <h5>Levels</h5>
      <p>
        Levels are used to identify a skill level, normally ranging from 2.0 to
        5.0. These levels are actually called DUPR ratings. After having played
        in a tournament at a 3.0 level or 3.5 level for example you will quickly
        learn if that level of play was too easy or too difficult for you and
        your partner. In a subsequent tournament you might move up (if the level
        you chose was too easy) or move down.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are going in a tournament for the first time you may not know how
        to choose an appropriate level. We will help you out with that at a
        later time.
      </p>
      <h5>Age</h5>
      <p>
        Sometimes an event may give you an option to select an age category. For
        example there could be an over 50 category that you can choose where
        both partners need to be over the age of 50. There may be a 65+
        category. The purpose of an age category is to allow the older folks to
        play amongst themselves and not have to compete against those young (and
        quick) youngsters!
      </p>
