      <h3>What is Fab4Frenzy?</h3>
      <p>
        Fab4Frenzy offers an exciting new format where 4 people (2 men and 2
        women) form a team. There are only 6 teams that participate in a
        Fab4Frenzy tournament, 24 people. Every point counts in this tournament
        - the total number of points accumulated determines the order of finish.
        The number of wins will only come in play if there is a tie in the total
        number of points. Reporting takes place throughout the event. This is
        exciting because you can compare your accumulated points to the other
        teams throughout the competition and continuously know where you stand.
        This information will be updated promptly and you can view your progress
        by checking out the charts that will be posted just outside of the gym.
      </p>
      <p>Tournaments normally have the following characteristics:</p>
      <h5>Gender</h5>
      <p>
        There are 2 men and 2 women in each team.
      </p>
      <h5>Levels</h5>
      <p>
        A tournament will cater to a certain level (anywhere from 2.5 to 4.0).
        Please ensure you register only if your level of play matches what we
        are looking for in a given tournament - do not participate if you should
        be playing at a higher level. We prefer that you wait until we hot
        another Fab4Frenzy event for you level.
